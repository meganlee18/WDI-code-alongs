# why automated testing why TDD

1. we write test to PROVE your code does what you THINK it does

2. tests help define the problem you are trying to solve

3. tests help you verify that new changes or refactors don't break the rest of your code

```ruby

def get_age(year_of_birth, current_year)
# find out the current year
# current_year - year_of_birth
end

test(8, 2010, 2018)

```
